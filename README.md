# House Price Prediction Model
This repository contains the code and analysis for a House Price Prediction project based on a Kaggle dataset. The objective of this project was to predict house prices using various machine learning models.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle's House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition. It includes detailed house features such as:
#### Lot size
#### Year built
#### Number of rooms
#### Neighborhood
#### Various other features affecting house prices

# Project Workflow
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explored feature distributions, correlations, and missing data.
Visualized trends and patterns in housing prices.
## Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values.
Applied feature encoding for categorical variables.
Normalized and scaled numerical features.
# Feature Engineering:
Identified and selected key features using statistical and domain knowledge.
Engineered new features to improve model performance.
# Modeling:

Trained various machine learning models for regression.
Used techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
Modeling
# Implemented the following models:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
Support Vector Regression
# Evaluation metrics included:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
